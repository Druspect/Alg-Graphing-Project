# Alg-Graphing-Project
Graphing project for algorithm engineering. Includes code, report and output files.

Conflict generators are separated into bimodal, exponential, and power law distributions. the graph coloring pt2 py file will accept the output file generated by any of these generators as shown in the AlgProject.ipynb jupyter notebook. You can interactively generate, see, and input the graphs into the orderer.
